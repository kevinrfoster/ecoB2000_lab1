*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. When submitting
assignments, please include your name and the assignment number as part
of the filename. Please write the names of your study group members at
the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Write up the results of your Lab 1 work. I don’t want all of your
    output, please pick the interesting bits (and start thinking about
    what makes a result interesting?).
3.  Now I want you to do something really difficult: create a new
    playlist in your favorite music app. Try to mix it up, in terms of
    genre, artist and ratings. I’d like you to do a bit of stats related
    to the “shuffle” algorithm of that music player. I think about this
    sometimes, when the shuffle from a large playlist serves up yet
    another track from the same artist and same album – doesn’t it
    sometimes seem like the shuffle gets stuck? When we start playing
    music from a playlist, do you think that is an entirely random draw?
    If there are N songs in the playlist, then is the chance of any one
    being selected just 1/N? Or are there other factors such as ratings?
    These other factors could be positive or negative, perhaps a
    playlist would seem more random if it downweighted the probability
    of playing multiple songs by the same artist? Anyway, I’d like you
    to collect some data about this, by somehow keeping track of which
    songs get shuffled and then forming a hypothesis test about whether
    those seem to be randomly selected. You should choose what
    hypothesis to test and how many observations to use. Tell me a bit
    about your experimental setup, your hypothesis, your recorded data,
    and what you can conclude from this little experiment. Many
    scientific papers include a conclusion that, “more study is needed”,
    so don’t worry, you can keep listening to your tunes even
    afterwards!
